<h1>Native American Land-Use Practices and Ecological Impacts</h1>
by M. KAT ANDERSON American Indian Studies Center, University of California, Los Angeles, California and MICHAEL J. MORATTO California State University

During a span of 10,000 years or more, Native Americans in the Sierra Nevada were sustained by hunting and fishing, gathering, lithic quarrying, and trading. To meet their requirements for firewood, fish and game, vegetal foods, craft supplies, and building materials, the native peoples of the Sierra managed biotic resources intensively, with significant ecological and evolutionary consequences. The distribution, structure, composition, and extent of certain plant communities, for example, were shaped by burning, pruning, sowing, weeding, tilling, and selective harvesting.

Numerous “protoagricultural” techniques, based upon traditional knowledge of natural processes gained over the millennia, were applied to increase the quantity and improve select qualities of focal plant species. Fire was the most important management tool, employed to clear brush, maintain grasslands and meadows, improve browse for deer, enhance production of basketry and cordage materials, modify understory species composition in forests, and reduce fuel accumulation that might otherwise sustain intense fires. Considering that the human population of the Sierra Nevada was approximately 90,000–100,000 in late prehistoric times (ca. A.D. 1300–1800), the environmental consequences of aboriginal land-use and management practices were substantial.

There is currently an ecological “vacuum,” or disequilibrium, in the Sierra resulting from the departure of Native American influences. The recent decline in biotic diversity, species extirpation and endangerment, human encroachment into fire-type plant communities (e.g., chaparral), and greatly increased risk of catastrophic fires are but symptoms of this disequilibrium. It is recommended, therefore, that land-managing agencies and land-use planners incorporate Native American traditional knowledge into future policies and programs for ecosystem management in the Sierra Nevada. This traditional knowledge, which permitted the adaptive success of large human populations and the maintenance of Sierran environments for more than a hundred centuries, must not be dismissed.
<h3>Relevance of Native American Environmental History to Sierra Nevada Ecosystem Project Objectives</h3>

Knowledge of the history of natural systems is an essential component of scientific analysis (Crumley 1994; Smith 1994). This history influences our ability to assess the present health and condition of ecosystems in the Sierra Nevada and to predict the future (Woolfenden 1994). Plant-community organization and assemblages are expressions of species evolution and species behavior (Whittaker and Woodwell 1972), and plant adaptations are responses to past environmental conditions. Native Americans, as integral residents of the Sierra Nevada, modified environmental conditions, dispersed plant species to new areas, and created recent evolutionary modifications in the flora through human selection for particular traits. Thus, Native Americans were instigators of ecosystemic change with varying degrees of intensity during the time they inhabited the Sierra, beginning some 10,000 years ago (Elston et al. 1977; Moratto 1984; Moratto et al. 1988; Peak and Crew 1990; Rondeau 1982).

The Sierra Nevada did not fit the definition of an uninhabited, virgin wilderness at the point of Euro-American contact. Rather, it had been shaped by thousands of years of indigenous burning, pruning, sowing, selective harvesting, and tilling (Anderson and Nabhan 1991; Simms 1992). Native Americans have managed Sierran ecosystems in a nonrandom fashion, using a variety of horticultural techniques. Such management is substantiated by ethnohistoric and ethnographic records, studies of museum artifacts, paleoecological findings, fire scar studies, and ecological field studies (Anderson 1993b; Anderson and Carpenter 1991; Kilgore and Taylor 1979; Lewis 1993; Matson 1972; Roper Wickstrom 1987). Furthermore, early humans were effective hunters, influencing the distribution, abundance, and diversity of wildlife within their tribal territories. To understand the vegetation of a particular locality or region at a specific time requires knowledge of soil, topography, climate, natural processes, and history of land use by Native Americans.

We are in the first stages of documenting in a detailed and intensive manner the prehistoric and historic land-management practices in the Sierra Nevada. Deliberate management of wild plant and animal resources and habitats was a major element of Native American subsistence strategies. Yet, investigation of the relationships between such land-management activities and their ecological consequences is a nascent field of study. In fact, there exists no synthesis or detailed analysis of past wildlife management by Native Americans and its potential ecological impacts in the Sierra Nevada. It is clear that Native American land-management practices had significant ecological and evolutionary consequences on the biota, but the details of these impacts will remain unknown for specific geographic regions until interdisciplinary teams conduct more comprehensive studies.
