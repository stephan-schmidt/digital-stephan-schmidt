<h1 class="">VIDEO: Forest restoration finance and policy</h1>
Over the past decade, the number of severe wildfires has been steadily increasing, driven by unnaturally high forest density and climate change. “Megafires,” wildfires that scorch over 100,000 acres, are especially dangerous. Not only are these record-breaking fires costly to put out, they also pose huge threats to water supply, wildlife, infrastructure, and communities that last long after the fire is extinguished. Understanding megafires is the first step towards addressing them. Dr. Paul Hessburg, a research landscape ecologist, explains the causes and cures, then speaks with a panel of restoration and finance experts and practitioners to explain how better restoration finance and policy can lead to less severe fires in the future.
